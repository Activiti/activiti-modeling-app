## Introduction

The Alfresco Modeling Application is an extended version of the [Activiti Modeling application  (AMA)](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-modeling-app), built using
[Alfresco Application Development Framework (ADF)](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components) components.

## Installing dependencies

Run the following command to install all third-party dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

## App required environment variables

We need to set some environment variables to be able to run the local dev server. In the project root folder, create a `.env` file (this is gitignored) with the following data:

```bash
# App config settings
APP_CONFIG_BPM_HOST="<url>"
APP_CONFIG_ECM_HOST="<url>"
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_HOST="<url>"
APP_CONFIG_IDENTITY_HOST="<url>"
APP_CONFIG_PROVIDER="ALL"
APP_CONFIG_AUTH_TYPE="OAUTH"
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_CLIENTID="alfresco"
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_IMPLICIT_FLOW=true
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_SILENT_LOGIN=true
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_SILENT_IFRAME_URI="{protocol}//{hostname}{:port}/assets/silent-refresh.html"
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_LOGIN=/
APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_LOGOUT=/
APP_CONFIG_APPS_DEPLOYED="[{"name": "simpleapp"}]"

# MODELING RELATED

### Running the application

Use one of the following commands to run the application:

```bash
# develop server
npm start

# Production server
npm start -- --prod
```

### Building the application

Use one of the following commands to build the application:

```bash
# develop build
npm run build

# Production build
npm run build -- --prod
```

### Running unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Running in Docker

First build the application as above.

Then `docker build . -t alfresco/alfresco-apps:latest` to build the image

Start with below (substituting with values for your deployment):

`docker run -it -e APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_HOST="http://KEYCLOAKHOST/auth/realms/activiti" -e APP_CONFIG_OAUTH2_CLIENTID="activiti" -e APP_CONFIG_BPM_HOST="http://GATEWAYHOST" -p 8080:80 alfresco/alfresco-modeling-app:latest`

If any substitutions don't work then check that the placeholders in `docker-entrypoint.sh` match `src/app.config.json`

## Browser Support

The application is supported in the following browsers:

| **Browser**   | **Version** |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Chrome        | Latest      |
